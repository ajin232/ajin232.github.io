                        <p>I collected data from the World Bank's Open Data site and used Tableau to visualize how different G20 nations (plus Spain) compare to each other on six different metrics. The visualization allows you to choose which metric to compare and also which country (if any) to use as the baseline (the relative zero).</p>

                        <h4>Spring 2024: UMD Gardening web app</h4>
                        <p>In a web application development course, I worked in a group to create a web app to help people search for plants that they could grow in their garden based on their desired parameters, such as space required, sunlight available, etc. To create this app, we used HTML/CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Node.js and ExpressJS with REST api. I also created a Figma prototype for a hypothetical mobile port of the web app.</p>

                        <h4>Fall 2023: Kitchen App for Human-Computer Interaction</h4>
                        <p>As part of a group project for a human-computer interaction and UI/UX course, I helped to create a prototype of an app that could allow multiple people &#8212; such as roommates or family members &#8212; to catalog the food that they purchase, keep record of who bought what, store and share recipes and more. The app was created in HTML/CSS and javascript, and as per the assignment's instructions, it is only intended to be run at 640x960 viewport resolution. I was largely responsible for designing the front-end interface and layout across the app, but I also contributed code to the backend javascript.</p>

                        <h4>Spring 2023: Cybersecurity Group Project in C</h4>
                        <p>While taking a cybersecurity course, I completed a group programming project whereby we had to design virtual Bank and ATM terminals and have them take in user input and communicate with each other, while also building in defenses to protect against a malicious third party intercepting, modifying or hijacking the communications between the ATM and Bank. This project was written in C. I was largely responsible for the code in atm.c, but I also contributed to other parts of the project.</p>

                        <p>I played a part in filming and editing this promotional video for CNS-TV, the broadcasting channel of the Capital News Service at the University of Maryland. This video was produced as a group project for a promo production course.</p>

                        <p>On election night in 2022, I was in charge of producing graphics, graphics templates and animations for the show. This also involved producing graphics in real time based on the latest election board information that was coming in. I created the red/blue wipe animation in After Effects on very short notice.</p>
