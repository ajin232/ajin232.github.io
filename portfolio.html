Scroll through to take a look at projects that I have worked on, both cooperatively and individually. Many of them relate directly to my coursework in the fields of computer science and journalism.

                    <h3>Fall 2023: Kitchen App for Human-Computer Interaction</h3>
                    <p>As part of a group project for a human-computer interaction and UI/UX course, I helped to create a prototype of an app that could allow multiple people &#8212; such as roommates or family members &#8212; to catalog the food that they purchase, keep record of who bought what, store and share recipes and more. The app was created in HTML/CSS and javascript, and as per the assignment's instructions, it is only intended to be run at 640x960 viewport resolution. I was largely responsible for designing the front-end interface and layout across the app, but I also contributed code to the backend javascript.</p>

                    <h3>Spring 2023: Cybersecurity Group Project in C</h3>
                    <p>While taking a cybersecurity course, I completed a group programming project whereby we had to design virtual Bank and ATM terminals and have them take in user input and communicate with each other, while also building in defenses to protect against a malicious third party intercepting, modifying or hijacking the communications between the ATM and Bank. This project was written in C. I was largely responsible for the code in atm.c, but I also contributed to other parts of the project.</p>

                    <p>On election night in 2022, I was in charge of producing graphics, graphics templates and animations for the show.
