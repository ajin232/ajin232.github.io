                                <p>As part of a group project for a human-computer interaction and UI/UX course, I helped to create a prototype of an app that could allow multiple people &#8212; such as roommates or family members &#8212; to catalog the food that they purchase, keep record of who bought what, store and share recipes and more. The app was conceptualized and wireframed in multiple stages, and then developed in HTML/CSS and javascript, and as per the assignment's instructions, it is only intended to be run at 640x960 viewport resolution. I was largely responsible for designing the front-end interface and layout across the app, and also contributed code to the backend javascript. <span style = "font-weight: 600"> Documentation of the UX design process is provided in pdf format in my repository.</span></p>

Additionally, I had variously been a camera operator, floor director and graphics operator on the show.</p>

                                <p>On election night in 2022, I was in charge of producing graphics, graphics templates and animations for the show. This also involved producing graphics in real time based on the latest election board information that was coming in. I created the red/blue wipe animation in After Effects on very short notice. These visual assets are visible in the recorded livestream video.</p>
